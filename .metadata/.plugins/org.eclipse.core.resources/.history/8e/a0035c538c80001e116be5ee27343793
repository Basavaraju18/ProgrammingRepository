/**A bit is the smallest unit of data that a computer can process and store. A bit is a binary digit, which can only hold one of two values: 0 or 1. These values correspond to the electrical values of off or on, respectively. 

* The number of possible values or combinations goes up by a factor of two with each additional bit. For example, in 1 bit there are two possible values: 1 or 0. In 2 bits, there are four possible values, or combinations: 00, 01, 10, 11. 

*A group of 4 bits is called a nibble, and 8-bits makes a byte. Computers are sometimes classified by the number of bits they can process at one time or by the number of bits they use to represent addresses.
